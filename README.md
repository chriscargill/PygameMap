# Pygame Map
___
<br>

## What is it?

### This program is the starter for some other things I want to do at a later time. It can be used to create a 2D map or environment. The whole purpose is to be able to manuever around a screen including zooming in and out of that screen. Items may be placed and removed from the screen and their locations stored even if they go off screen.

## What doesn't work?  

### As it now stands not everything in this program works (it is a work in progress). Zoom functionality is not implemented. Also, the collision detection system has a couple of bugs that need to be worked out. I plan on tackling these soon.

## What works?  

### The things you can do are place blocks of different colors anywhere on the map and move the red square (the character) throughout the environment.
